# About the project.

### The project in question uses Java and Kafka to implement a real-time 
### messaging system. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows
### publishing and subscribing to streams of records in real time. With Java,
### we can develop robust and scalable applications that integrate with Kafka
### to process, store and analyze large volumes of data in real time. 
### This integration can be used in a variety of use cases, such as event 
### processing, real-time data analysis, large-scale data ingestion, among others.

## Technology used :
-  JAVA --  SPRING BOOT - KAFKA
-  DOCKER -- INTEGRATION AND UNIT TESTS -- MOCKITO
